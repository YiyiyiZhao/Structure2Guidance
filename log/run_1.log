In the scene, there is a laptop located in the central area in front of you. Towards your right, there is a banana placed slightly down diagonally to the right of the laptop. Further to your right and slightly above, there is a bottle. Moreover, there is a clock positioned at around 4 o'clock direction relative to the laptop. Additionally, a hand appears to have touched the bottle.
Extend your right hand in a slightly downward diagonal direction towards the right of the laptop. Move your hand a bit further to the right until you encounter a smooth, elongated object - that's the banana you're looking for. Continue moving your hand in that direction to reach the banana.

You have touched one of the bananas on the right side, which means you are close to the target object. Using your fingertips, move your hand slightly to the left to find the second banana next to it. Once you have confirmed the shape and texture of the banana, you will have successfully completed the task.
